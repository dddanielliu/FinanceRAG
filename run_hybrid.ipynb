( 12.3 % ) , compared to fiscal 2018 .\\nthe increase was primarily due to the kapstone acquisition and higher selling price/mix in our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments .\\nthese increases were partially offset by the absence of recycling net sales in fiscal 2019 as a result of conducting the operations primarily as a procurement function beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 , lower volumes , unfavorable foreign currency impacts across our segments compared to the prior year and decreased land and development net sales .\\nsegment income increased $ 82.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 , primarily due to increased corrugated packaging segment income that was partially offset by lower consumer packaging and land and development segment income .\\nthe impact of the contribution from the acquired kapstone operations , higher selling price/mix across our segments and productivity improvements was largely offset by lower volumes across our segments , economic downtime , cost inflation , increased maintenance and scheduled strategic outage expense ( including projects at our mahrt , al and covington , va mills ) and lower land and development segment income due to the wind-down of sales .\\nwith respect to segment income , we experienced higher levels of cost inflation in both our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 that were partially offset by recovered fiber deflation .\\nthe primary inflationary items were virgin fiber , freight , energy and wage and other costs .\\nwe generated $ 2310.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 , compared to $ 1931.2 million in fiscal 2018 .\\nwe remained committed to our disciplined
